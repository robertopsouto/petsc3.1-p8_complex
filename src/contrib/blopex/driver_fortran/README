PETSc must be configured with BLOPEX.  When you run PETSc's configure.py,
include the flag --download-blopex=1

Files:

makefile - the Unix makefile to compile the program.

ex2f_blopex.F - a modified version of the Fortran example ex2f.F from the PETSc
   source distribution (Version 2.3.3-p4) that illustrates a way of using
   BLOPEX with PETSc from Fortran.  Modifications are marked with WFM.

blopex_c.F90 - the C routines that interface between the Fortran routines and
   the BLOPEX code.
