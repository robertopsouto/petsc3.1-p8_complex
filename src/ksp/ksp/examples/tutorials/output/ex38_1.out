Initialization stage
Residual norm of starting guess: 10.768840
Residual norm of relaxation after 0.0001 20 relaxations: 0.0343961 10.7688
Initialization stage: creating level 2
Level 2 can be treated directly.
Algorithm will use 2 levels.
After 1 iterations residual norm is 0.001871
After 1 iterations Rayleigh quotient of residual is 0.068008
After 2 iterations residual norm is 0.000026
After 2 iterations Rayleigh quotient of residual is 0.059753
After 3 iterations residual norm is 0.000000
After 3 iterations Rayleigh quotient of residual is 0.056987
General setup stage
Adding candidate vector 2
After 4 iterations residual norm is 0.000153
After 4 iterations Rayleigh quotient of residual is 0.025489
After 5 iterations residual norm is 0.000000
After 5 iterations Rayleigh quotient of residual is 0.026119
General setup stage
nd_fast is true
either too many candidates for storage or cycle is already effective
